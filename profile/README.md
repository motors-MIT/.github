## MIT Motor Lab

Hello and welcome to the MIT Motor Lab! We were started by the MIT Electric Vehicle Team (evt.mit.edu) in 2023 and our goal is to create a knowledge-base surrounding motors, motor control, motor testing, and motor design for both robotics and electric vehicles! Members of MIT's EVT, MITERS, the MIT Biomimetic Robotics Lab, as well as teaching staff @ MIT all contribute to motors.mit.edu!

If you want to contribute, email use @ motors@mit.edu!
